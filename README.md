# Disease-recommender System
This is a disease recommender system that I have created with the minimalist dataset I got from Kaggle.Here we had 3 datasets namely for disease symptoms, precautions and description.We combined the 3 for our ease to work with data and created Final_dataset.

You can clone this into your system.

# Getting Started

1. Fork [this](https://github.com/himaniaggarwal2/disease-recommender.git) repository.
2. Clone this forked repository in your local system by the following commands:
> git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/disease-recommender.git

3. To Navigate to the project directory.
   >ls

   >cd  disease-recommender

4. Create a new branch in it.
   > git checkout -b `<your-branch-name>`
5. To check whether you are not in master branch 
   >git branch

check the star in front of the two
   
```
    master
    *<your-branch-name>
```
5. Make changes in it.
6. Run it.
7. Stage your changes and commit it.

You need to maintain the version control of the changes u made. It helps when working on the current repository.
